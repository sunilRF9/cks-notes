What is the command to allow a tcp port range between 1000 and 2000 in ufw?
-- ufw allow starting\_port:ending_port/protocol
-- ufw allow 1000:2000/tcp

On the node01 host, add a rule to allow incoming SSH connections.
-- ufw allow 22

We have some services on node01 host, which are running on tcp port 9090 and 9091. Add ufw rules to allow incoming connection on these ports from IP range 135.22.65.0/24 to any interface on node01.
-- ufw allow from <ip> to any port <port> proto <protocol>
-- ufw allow from 135.22.65.0/24 to any port 9090 proto tcp
-- ufw allow from 135.22.65.0/24 to any port 9091 proto tcp
-- ufw enable

This service was identified to have several vulnerabilities in it. Disable the port 80 on node01 for ALL incoming requests.
--- ufw deny <port>
--- ufw deny 80
